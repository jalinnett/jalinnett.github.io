        <h1>Where it all started:</h1>
        <p>Ever since being a little kid, I've been drawn to mechanical things. I'd always stare at objects like ceiling fans and try to understand how they worked. So it was only natural that I was drawn to cars. As I got older, got toys for gifts, played car games online, and saw cars in person, my obsession grew.</p>
        <p>Moving on to present day, after saving up I finally purchased my own "fun car," a 2015 Mustang. As I drive the car more, not only do I improve my skills behind the wheel, but I also make connections with new people who share my passion. It's been a great time with this car, and I can't wait for the future and the modifications I plan to do to it!</p>
